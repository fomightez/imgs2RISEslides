    "\n",
    "1. Double-click on 'SLIDESHOW_IMGS' folder icon in the file browser panel to the left of this page. That will drop the navigation into the empty folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Drag-and-drop all the image files for making into slides into the empty file browser panel to the left of this page. (A gray dashed line will appear around the edge of the file browser when drag the file onto the file browser pane & at this point you can drop a file or files in by releasing the mouse button.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Give the image files time to upload. There were be a blue bar at the bottom to monitor the progress. **You don't want to continue until you are sure all the files are uploaded.**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. At the top of the panel where you just dragged the photos & to the left of the 'SLIDESHOW_IMGS' text, click on the Home icon to go back up to the level above the photos files in the file heierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Click in the next cell and execute the commands in the script by typing shift-return (or hit the play icon the menu at the top bar of this page).\n"

    "        <li>To run a code cell either click the <i class=\"fa-play fa\"></i> icon on the menu bar above, or click on the cell and then hit <b>Shift+Enter</b>. The <b>Shift+Enter</b> combo will also move you to the next cell, so it's a quick way to work through the notebook.</li>\n",

(A gray dashed line will appear around the edge of the file browser when drag the file onto the file browser pane & at this point you can drop a file or files in by releasing the mouse button.)\n",

    "\n",
    "4. At the top of the panel where you just dragged the photos & to the left of the 'PUT_IMAGES_HERE' text, click on the Home icon to go back up to the level above the photos files in the file heierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Click in the next cell and execute the commands in the script by typing shift-return (or hit the play icon the menu at the top bar of this page).\n"
